            "There is no difference in scoring"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        explanation: "The main difference is that for non-typical deer, the total length of abnormal points is added to the score, while for typical deer, it's subtracted as part of the differences. (How to Score North American Big Game, p. 130-131)"

    {
        question: "What should be done if a normal point is broken off to less than an inch long?",

            "Record it as an abnormal point",
            "Record a zero and note it in the Remarks section"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 3,
        explanation: "If a normal point has been broken off to less than an inch long, record a zero to indicate its condition and note the action in the Remarks section. This preserves the sequence and avoids any artificial penalty for non-symmetry. (How to Score North American Big Game, p. 127)"
